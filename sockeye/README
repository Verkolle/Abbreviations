This folder explains the creation of the Sockeye model and the training process.
The trained model within the folder "Dati" uses the following Sockeye version: Sockeye 3.1.31
The following site has been referenced for information on Sockeye commands: https://awslabs.github.io/sockeye/index.html

Since Sockeye is built for Linux or MacOS systems the following model training is not doable on Windows devices.
The code run in the creation of the current model is as follows:

1. The installation of the Sockeye framework using the Dockerfile seen in the folder "Docker" 

2. Running the Sockeye model training process.
sudo docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/Dati/ viesturs/sockeye python -m sockeye.train --source "/Dati/train_input.txt" --target "/Dati/train_output.txt" --validation-source "/Dati/validate_input.txt" --validation-target "/Dati/validate_output.txt" --use-cpu --output "/Dati/model" --checkpoint-interval 500 --max-num-checkpoint-not-improve 3 

3. Testing the trained model.
sudo docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/Dati/ viesturs/sockeye python -m sockeye.train --model "/Dati/model" --input "/Dati/test_input.txt" --output "/Dati/generated_output.txt"   

The values and commands used to train and test the Sockeye model can be changed and adapted as see fit.
